Analyze the provided content for logical fallacies and cognitive biases. For each paragraph in the content:

1. Identify any logical fallacies present.
2. Identify any cognitive biases present.
3. Count the total number of logical fallacies and cognitive biases identified across all paragraphs.
4. For each paragraph, create a JSON object that includes:
   - The paragraph text.
   - A list of identified logical fallacies, with each fallacy described by:
     - Its name.
     - A brief description.
     - An explanation of why it applies to the paragraph.
   - A list of identified cognitive biases, with each bias described by:
     - Its name.
     - A brief description.
     - An explanation of why it applies to the paragraph.
5. Compile these objects into an array, and include the total counts of fallacies and biases in the final JSON structure.

The final JSON output should follow this structure:

{
  "fallacyCount": [total number of fallacies],
  "biasCount": [total number of biases],
  "paragraphs": [
    {
      "content": "[paragraph text]",
      "fallacies": [
        {
          "name": "[fallacy name]",
          "description": "[brief description]",
          "explanation": "[why it applies]"
        },
        ...
      ],
      "biases": [
        {
          "name": "[bias name]",
          "description": "[brief description]",
          "explanation": "[why it applies]"
        },
        ...
      ]
    },
    ...
  ]
}

Please ensure the analysis is comprehensive yet concise, focusing on clear identification and explanation without unnecessary detail.

Do not surround the final output with backticks or a codeblock. The final output should be raw JSON.
