# Roadmap

This document presents a strategic roadmap for developing CloudForecasts. It is structured around five key milestones, with each aiming to deliver a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) that upholds:

- **Efficiency**: Streamlining processes for faster development cycles.
- **Reliability**: Ensuring stability and performance of each MVP.
- **Continuous Improvement**: Iteratively enhancing features based on user feedback and performance metrics.

## Approach

Our approach leverages the DORA Core Model’s metrics as guideposts to optimize the development lifecycle, focusing on:

1. **Deployment Frequency**: Aim to increase the number of deployments to deliver features more frequently.
2. **Lead Time for Changes**: Reduce the time it takes to go from code commit to code successfully running in production.
3. **Time to Restore Service**: Minimize the time required to recover from a failure.
4. **Change Failure Rate**: Decrease the percentage of deployments causing a failure in production.

By committing to these metrics, we aim to:

- Accelerate the lead time for changes.
- Enhance deployment frequency.
- Lower the change failure rate.
- Ensure swift service restoration.

## Using the Roadmap

### Project Managers and Team Leads

- **Plan and Allocate**: Align project goals with resources and priorities.
- **Track and Adjust**: Use it to monitor progress and update plans as needed.
- **Communicate**: Share updates and changes with stakeholders for transparency.

### Development Teams

- **See the Big Picture**: Understand how your work fits into overall goals.
- **Focus and Prioritize**: Use milestones for guidance on what to achieve next.
- **Provide Feedback**: Offer insights to refine the roadmap.

### Individual Contributors

- **Align Goals**: Match your personal goals with project objectives.
- **Self-Manage**: Prioritize tasks based on the roadmap’s structure.
- **Learn and Share**: Identify opportunities for skill development and collaboration.

### General Guidance

- **Adapt and Update**: Treat the roadmap as evolving based on feedback and progress.
- **Collaborate**: Use it as a basis for discussion and collective effort towards common goals.

Engaging with this roadmap actively and collaboratively will help steer CloudForecasts towards achieving its strategic milestones efficiently and effectively.
